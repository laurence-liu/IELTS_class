# A beautiful city

I have ever been to a lot of cities, but today I want to talk about Paris. Paris is the most beautiful city I have ever visit. Not only romantic, but also fashion. A lot of famous brands comes from in this city, such as Chanel, Dior, Chloe and LV.

People in Paris are lazy and cozy. There are a lot of coffee shops beside the Seine. Traveller can order a cup of coffee and sit over there for a day without doing anything. Visiting Louvre Museum is also a good idea. It may takes five or more days if someone wants to visit all of collections in the museum. Louvre Museum has world-famous artworks in there. Mona lisa, for example, is the best of Leonardo da Vinci.

Due to the fact that France is attractive me for many reason. I will definitely visit France again in the future.
