# A new language you want to learn

Off the top of my head, I would say Spanish is a new language which I want to learn. This is because there was a thing happened when I went to the United State one years ago.

My friend and I went to California last year. We drove car from San Francisco to San Diego. We visited a lot of famous beaches, such as Santa Cruz, Santa Monica, Venice beach and La Jolla. All of them had a common point is that there were a lot of Latino girls. My friends always got drunk at every beach. He tried to hit on Latino girls without English. Due to the fact that he wanted to impress those girls. So we started to learn simple conversation in Spanish. But things didn't turn out the way we wanted, we stood in front of them like woods after we said "Hola" and introduced ourselves. That was an embarrassed but funny memory.

In fact, Spanish is popular in the world, preceded only by English and Chinese. So if I have a change to learn a new language. Spanish will be my first choose.
