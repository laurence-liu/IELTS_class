## Original

Recently, I ~~work as~~ a software engineer for four years. I ~~pretty~~ enjoy this job, because I have to learn many new ~~stuff~~ from internet, ~~it's~~ also ~~feel~~ great when I demonstrate my websit or application to users who are using our product.

To be honest, my dream job is working in the great company, something like Google, Facebook or Microsoft etc. It is not an easy thing unless I work hard every day. People have to set some goal to achieve ~~to make~~ their life ~~more~~ better, and I believe it would be great to my life if I try to do this.
