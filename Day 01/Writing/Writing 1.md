# Where do you live

## Original

Basically, I live in house with my parents, sisters and nephew.

In fact, I don't like to live with my family, because I ~~enjoy alone~~.

Personally, I think I will ~~leave outside~~ in the future, when people ~~growing up~~, they can not always stay with their parents, everyone should learn how to be an independent person.

Personally, I think I will `live outside(move)` in the future, when people `grow up`, they can not always stay with their parents, everyone should learn how to be an independent person.
