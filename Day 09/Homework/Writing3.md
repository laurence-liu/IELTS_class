# A good law in your country

If I can choose, I would say capital punishment is a good law in my country. Although this is a critical issue which is full of argument, I think it may decrease crime rate.

Some of countries still implement this law, such as America, China, Japan. On the other hand, due to human right, a lot of countries already forbid this law, including: Canada, France, UK.

Due to the face that there is a saying goes "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth". So I think capital punishment is a necessary law in my country. Life matters, but not for someone who doesn't respect lives.
