# A friend from your youth that you remember

## Original

When I was a junior high school student, I had a friend who was the ~~most smart~~ kid in our class, ~~he against~~ the school rules ~~as possible as~~ he could, he was not only a bad student, but also got the highest score ~~in~~ ~~test~~ all the time. ~~Somebody~~ liked to got along with him, but ~~somebody~~ ~~envy~~ him ~~because~~ his attitude.

We still keep in touch now, we ~~knew~~ each other more than ten years, he always ~~encourage~~ me when I ~~faced~~ some critical issues, I think no matter how long it's we still will be friend.

## Correct

When I was a junior high school student, I had a friend who was the `smartest` kid in our class, he `always` against the school rules `as more as` he could, he was not only a bad student, but also got the highest score `on` `tests` all the time. `Some of my classmates` liked to got along with him, but some `envied` him `because of` his attitude.

We still keep in touch now, we ~~knew~~ each other more than ten years, he always `encourages` me when I `face` some critical issues, I think no matter how long it's we still will be friend.
