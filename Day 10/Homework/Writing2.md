# Task 2

## A growing number of people feel that animals should not be exploited by people and that they should have the same rights as humans, while others argue that humans must employ animals to satisfy their various needs, including uses for food and research

## Discuss both views and give your opinion

In the day and age, this critical issue already get attention by the amount of people. Some of them are from the group named World Animal Protection who are thinking about animal should not be exploited by humans. However, others people are from financial group who are taking animals should satisfy humans for granted. The following essay will discuss both view with examples and my opinions.

On the one hand, the people who are coming from World Animal Protection believe that humans have no right to slave animals. Due to animals just like humans, both of us are living creatures. For example, World Animal Protection had tried to ban bullfighting in Europe in 1985. Due to the fact they thought humans not only played bulls like toy, but also ate them after bulls fail the competition. In my opinion, this is a good thing what they did. They really protect the right of animals.

On the other hand, the amount of people who are from financial group have faith in that humans are at the top of food chain. There are a lot of examples for this situation, such as slaughterhouse, meat factory and animal farm. All of them are trying to turn animals into foods for human. So that they are able to earn more money. In my own point of view, they are doing the right thing due to the fact that humans need to eat meat to gain more energy.

To sum up, although people have different opinions about exploit animals, I support humans should employ animals to satisfy for needs. This is because if we didn't slave animals in early society, our civilization may not have processed this fast. Also humans are not able to balance their health if they just eat vegetables and fruits.
