# Task 2

## Government investment in the visual arts, the kind you commonly see in art galleries, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead

## To what extent do you agree with this statement

In the day and age, many local governments spend a large amount of money not only on public services, but also on the visual arts. Although spending money on the visual arts is not a bad thing, I think public services are more important than those. The following essay will support this view with examples.

On the one hand, spending budget on the visual arts is able to raise the culture of art for a city. For example, local governments build the art museum in the city not only improve the travel industry, but also beautify the view. So I agree local government should spent some money on this.

On the other hand, due to the fact that some public transportation already operate more than twenty years, even more. Such as the subway of New York, or the MRT in Taipei. Local governments need to pay more attention on the safe of passengers. Some of those passengers may from abroad, it would be a tragic thing if they injure when they take the bus for railway. Not only bad for the image of the city, but also hurt the tourism industry. Therefore, I think local government should spent more cost sheet on public service like transportation.

In conclusion, local governments should share budget for both of the visual arts and public services. But I don't think it is a good idea separate the budget equally. Due to the fact that they are influence to the different issues.
