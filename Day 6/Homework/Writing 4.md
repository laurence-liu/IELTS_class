# A trip by public transport

Sun Moon Lake in Nantou Taiwan, where is a quiet place and I have been to there to spend some leisure times. Sun Moon Lake has the most glamorous scene in Taiwan, and it is also the reason why many foreign tourists choose this place to be their first stop if they plan a trip.

After passing few busy days in the job, I really need some moments for myself. I like to go there for chill out and I prefer the evening hours. When I sit in front of the lake and staring at the lake which reflects the sunset. At that moment, I can feel wind blow on my face, birds singing on the trees. My body and mind relax instantly. Everything seems in slow motion. I think that was the first time I feel carefree in my life.
