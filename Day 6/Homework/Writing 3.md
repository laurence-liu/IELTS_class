# A website you use

There are a lot of websites in the world, but today I want to talk about "Google.com" which is also the most powerful website I have ever used.

As we all know, internet started a new era in 21 century which also has been called "The age of explosion of knowledge". In these days, parents always told their children to ask Google if they have any problems in their daily life, homework, train schedule event an address. Moreover, Google not only plays the role of a teacher, but also an private assistant. Everyone has an easy access to all sorts of information from it.

In my opinion, Google has become the most influential website in the world. In fact, "Google search" is only a part of its' function. As far as users concerned, Google is more than a website but a platform which provides many kind of services. As for me, the first thing I have to do in the morning is that I have to use "Gmail" to check my email. After that, I woke up "Google home" to play some music to welcome my fresh day. Furthermore, "Google calendar" helps me to check my schedule everyday.

In conclusion, it seems Google already take over my life, but I really enjoy that it enhances the quality of my life. Also, people who in nowadays need to introspect the side effect of the dramatic growth of technology.
