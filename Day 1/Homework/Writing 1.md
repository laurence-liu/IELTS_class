# A sport you have watched and would like to try

I love to do some exerice about water activities, like surfing, swimming or snorkeling, not only for the sunshine, but also for the wide sea, when I stand on the beach and watch the sunset, wind blows on my face, everything is so chill and slow.

About one years ago, I met my friend wearing diving suit and prepared to put out to sea when I was snorkeling nearby the sea of north Taiwan, at that moment I decide I would try to diving someday in the future.
