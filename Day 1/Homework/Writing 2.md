# Something that helps you to study

Study for some people is a boring thing, it not like reading, when someone is studing, he or she will foucus on memorize something or cauculate some complicate math problem,  even some issue they will never face in their life.

Basically, I listen to some classic music or light music which helps me memorize some dull things, or listen to some rock music which helps me calculate math, in the other hand, sometimes I will study with my friends who can discuss with me, in my opinion, it will help each other to improve more fast.
