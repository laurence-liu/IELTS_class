# Something that helps you to study

Study for some people is a boring thing, it not like reading, when someone is study, he or she will foucus on memorize something or cauculate some complicate math problem even some issue they will never face in real life.

Basically, I listen to some music like classic music or light music which helps me memorize some dull things, or listen to some rock music which helps me cauculate math, in the other hand, something I will study with my friends who can with me, in my opinion, it helps each other to imporve more fast.
