* You should spend about 20 minutes on this task.

* The graph below shows the different modes of transport used to travel to and from work in one American city in 1950, 1970 and 1990.

According to this bar chart, the vertical axis shows the percentage of total travellers use bus, car, bike or foot as their transportations in one American city while the horizontal gives the modes of transport in 1950, 1970 and 1990.

In terms of cars, it is rising from just over 5% in 1950 to 25% in 1970, and then clibing to almost 40% in 1990. Over 25% of commuters used bikes in 1950 then drop to less than 10% in 1990. Same as the commuters who walked to work, it was the most popular transportation in 1950, somehow to fell down to 10% in 1990.

As we can see, there are obviously data illustrate that the amount of people using cars grews considerably. By comparison, using bikes and foots decreased as time goes by. The range of rise and fall of bus are not obvious then the other three.
