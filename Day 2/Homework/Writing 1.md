# A song that means a lot to you

## Original

Personally, I think music ~~can~~ the most incredibly powerful thing in the world, it can heal poeple when someone is down or hurting.

If there ~~has~~ a song that means a lot to me, I would definitely say "Don't look back in anger" which ~~perform~~ by an United Kingdom band named "Oasis". About three years ago, my ex-girlfriend who dated me for four and half ~~year~~, left me ~~because~~ my ego and ~~selfish~~, I almost abandoned myselfe and got drunk all day long, I just ~~cloudn't~~ figure out what ~~happen~~ to my life. ~~Someday~~ morning my roommate ~~play~~ this song and told me, "You have to move on, everything you thought is meaningless, just don't look back in anger and ~~living~~ in the moment, all that won't ~~beat~~ you will eventually make you stronger."

Although I ~~am~~ already moved on and ~~get~~ better now, when I ~~heard~~ the melody I sill feel sorrow. I will always remember this ~~in~~ the rest of my life, and be a better person in the future.

Personally, I think music `can be` the most incredibly powerful thing in the world, it can heal poeple when someone is down or hurting.

If there `is` a song that means a lot to me, I would definitely say "Don't look back in anger" which `is performed` by an United Kingdom band named "Oasis". About three years ago, my ex-girlfriend who dated me for four and half `years`, left me `because of` my ego and `selfishness`, I almost abandoned myselfe and got drunk all day long, I just `could't` figure out what `happened` to my life. Oneday morning my roommate `played` this song and told me, "You have to move on, everything you thought is meaningless, just don't look back in anger and `live` in the moment, all that won't `kill` you will eventually make you stronger."

Although `I already moved on and better now`, when I `hear` the melody I sill feel sorrow. I will always remember `this the rest of my life`, and be a better person in the future.
