# A animal you think is interesting

In my opinion, cats are the most interesting animal on the earth, they are not only cute, but also smart. Moreover, cats also the most popular animal for most people. In overviews, cats don't need to walking like dogs, don't need to shower them regularly, also don't need to spend a lot of time to stay with them, because they live in their own world. In addtion to those, cats are also healing people, when they feeling donw.

In fact, We have a cat in my family that name is Jackie, she is already ten years old, my sister adopted her from the animal hospital where she worked. Jackie always yell to us when we're eatting, but we have no choice but igonre her, because she got diabetes three years ago. Jackie is the most carefree member in our home, apart from being leisurely, she is also lazy and sleepy, we have to force she doing some exercise everyday.

There are so many interesting animals in the earth, but cats are the most attractive for me for no reason, maybe it's because I have a cat by my side, cat's life is short, humans are lucky to have their company.
