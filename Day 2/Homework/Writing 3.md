# A animal you think is interesting

## Original

In my opinion, cats are the most interesting ~~animal~~ on the earth, they are not only cute, but also smart. Moreover, ~~cats also~~ the most popular ~~animal~~ for ~~most~~ people. In ~~overviews~~, ~~cats don't need to walking like dogs~~, ~~don't~~ need to shower them regularly, ~~also don't need to spend a lot of time to stay with them~~, because they live in their own world. In addition to those, ~~cats are also healing people, when they feeling donw.~~

In fact, we have a cat in my family ~~that~~ name is Jackie, she is already ten years old, my sister adopted her from the animal hospital where she worked. Jackie always ~~yell to~~ us when we're eatting, but we have no choice ~~but~~ igonre her~,~ because she got diabetes three years ago. Jackie is the most carefree member in our home, apart from being leisurely, she is also lazy and sleepy, we have to force she doing some exercise everyday.

There are so many interesting animals in the ~~earth~~, but cats are the most attractive ~~for~~ me for no reason, maybe it's because I have a cat by my side, ~~cat's~~ life is short, humans are lucky to have their company.

## Correct

In my opinion, cats are the most interesting `animals` on the earth, they are not only cute, but also smart. Moreover, cats `are` also the most popular `animals` for some of people. In `overview`, `we walk dogs, but don’t need to walk cats` `and` don't need to shower them regularly. `We also must` spend a lot of time to stay with them, because they live in their own world. In addition to those, `when people are feeling down, cats also comfort them.`

In fact, I have a cat in my family `her` name is Jackie, she is already ten years old, my sister adopted her from the animal hospital where she worked. Jackie always `yells at` us when we're eating, we have no choice `but to` ignore her `because` she got diabetes three years ago. Jackie is the most carefree member in our home; apart from being leisurely, she is also lazy and sleepy, we must force her to do some exercise everyday.

There are so many interesting animals in the `world`, but cats are the most attractive `to` me without reason. `Cats’` life is short, humans are lucky to have their company.
