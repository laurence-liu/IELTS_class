# A Game you liked to play when you were young

Off the top of my head, I would say hide and seek is the game I played with my friends and siblings when I was a child.

I still recall I played hide and seek when I was an elementary school student. We got 20 minutes to take a rest between classes. And there were 10 or more students played together. After the game started, I chose basement as my hiding place. About 15 minutes later, my friends started to yell my name and warned me that they were going to broadcast my name via the megaphone in the school. I couldn't put my finger on why exactly I ignored them at that moment. So they really did that. Everyone in school knew my name all of sudden. I think this is the most awkward things I have ever experienced.

Although We don't do a lot of things when we get older, I really miss the time we played this game in the playground.
