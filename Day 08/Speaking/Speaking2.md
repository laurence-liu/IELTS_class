# Why do many people go abroad to get more education

That some people choose to go abroad for their education is due to experience the life in the foreign country. On the other hand, some people want to get higher education.

As we all know, some famous universities are in the Unite State. Such as Stamford, Harvard or Yale. Some well-known art or music universities are in Europe. Such as Royal College of Art or Berlin University of the Arts.

In my opinion, those people who go abroad to get more education are chasing better life and trying to have more life experiences.
