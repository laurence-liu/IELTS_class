# Why is there a pay gap between men and women

Off the top of my head, I would say stereotype is the most unreasonable answer for the pay gap issue.

In early societies, people always believed that men were stronger or smarter than women, so the salary gap happened. The fact is there are more and more strong women in the world, such as the president of Germany or the CEO of the mobile company whose name is hTC. In nowadays, even five years old kid knows sexual discrimination is a wrong concept.

I don't know what the future will be, but I think this critical issue must be solved after the next generation.
