# Why has the birth rate in Taiwan decreased

As far as I am concerned, I would say there are two main reasons which are affecting the birth rate directly.

First thing is low salary, due to the fact that low salary for young people is a huge burden. In this situation, they are too afraid to raise a child. Second, some couples think having a pet is easier than fostering a kid. They do not need to spend a lot of time for children because they have to spend more time on work.

In conclusion, low salary and high working hours are important economic issues that Taiwan needs to solve. I don't know what will happen in the future, but I think Taiwan will be getting better if our government faces this problem.
