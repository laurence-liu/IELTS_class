# Why are there so many expensive buildings being built in Taiwan

Off the top of my head, I'd say the financial groups and the government are controlling the price of houses in Taiwan. This is all about money and benefit. This serial issues may cause the mess of economy. We should take the financial crisis which happended in 2008 as a warning.

On one hand, mega corporations build as more as they can and don't care about the needs. On the other hand, the government chooses to ignore them due to the fact that there are huge donations behind it.

In the foreseeable future, I think the problem of expensive buildings is going to exist until the economic issue crashes Taiwan.
