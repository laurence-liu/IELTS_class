# Task 2

## In the last 20 years, there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the internet social media Apps. However, these developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive in the future

## To what extent do you agree with this view

In the day and age, information technology changes the life of humans no matter good or bad. Albeit, internet causes several society problems, there is a saying "Every coin has its sides.", so we should not feel disappointed about the internet. The following essay will discuss this view with examples and reasons.

On one hand, it is true that the internet can cause some negative affects in society, internet scam, for example, is one of the most serious issues. Also the children get harmful information much easier, such as pornography and violence. Those contents need to be forbidden from teenagers who are under 18. The government should establish laws to deal with the chaos situations.

On the other hand, information technology not only changes the world, but also improves the life. Due to internet, there are a lot of things that we could do without going out from home, such as buying something, learning new things, even making a new relationship with others. Moreover, talking to the job and the friendship. First, the amount of people cloud work from home to take care their family. Second, friends could talk to each other with a simple network phone call.

To sum up, although people have different opinions about information technology. I disagree that it has more advantage than disadvantage in the future. Due to the fact that the benefits are than malpractice. The time has changed, we have to embrace the changes to adapt ourselves to the world.
